Guides
=====================================
Computing on Quantum or neuromorphic systems is fundamentally different than using traditional hardware and is a very active area of research with new algorithms surfacing almost on a weekly basis. Our guides are step-by-step instructions on how to utilise neuromorphic computing with the Dynex SDK. These examples are just some of multiple possibilities to perform machine learning tasks. However, they can be easily adopted to other use cases.

Using the Dynex SDK 
=====================================
Introduces the Dynex SDK and provides references to usage information. The Dynex Platform is intended to solve arbitrary application problems formulated as quadratic models. Problems submitted directly to the Dynex Platform are in the **binary quadratic model** (BQM>`_ format, unconstrained with binary-valued variables and structured for the topology of the Dynex Chips. They also accept arbitrarily structured quadratic models (QM>`_, constrained or unconstrained, with real, integer, and binary variables. The Dynex Platform, which implement state-of-the-art neuromorphic computations, is designed to accommodate even very large problems.

Neuromorphic Machine Learning
=====================================
Demonstrates various examples of neuromorphic enhanced Machine Learning techniques, for example Quantum-Boltzmann-Machines (QRBMs>`_, Quantum-Support-Vector-Machines (QSVM>`_ or feature optimisation with QBoost.

Quantum computing algorithms for machine learning harness the power of quantum mechanics to enhance various aspects of machine learning tasks. As both, quantum computing and neuromorphic computing are sharing similar features, these algorithms can also be computed efficiently on the Dynex platform â€“ but without the limitations of limited qubits, error correction or availability:

**Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM>`_:** QSVM is a quantum-inspired algorithm that aims to classify data using a quantum kernel function. It leverages the concept of quantum superposition and quantum feature mapping to potentially provide computational advantages over classical SVM algorithms in certain scenarios. 

**Quantum Principal Component Analysis (QPCA>`_:** QPCA is a quantum version of the classical Principal Component Analysis (PCA>`_ algorithm. It utilizes quantum linear algebra techniques to extract the principal components from high-dimensional data, potentially enabling more efficient dimensionality reduction in quantum machine learning.
  
**Quantum Neural Networks (QNN>`_:** QNNs are quantum counterparts of classical neural networks. They leverage quantum principles, such as quantum superposition and entanglement, to process and manipulate data. QNNs hold the potential to learn complex patterns and perform tasks like classification and regression, benefiting from quantum parallelism.

**Quantum K-Means Clustering:** Quantum K-means is a quantum-inspired variant of the classical K-means clustering algorithm. It uses quantum algorithms to accelerate the clustering process by exploring multiple solutions simultaneously. Quantum K-means has the potential to speed up clustering tasks for large-scale datasets. 

**Quantum Boltzmann Machines (QBMs>`_:** QBMs are quantum analogues of classical Boltzmann Machines, which are generative models used for unsupervised learning. QBMs employ quantum annealing to sample from a probability distribution and learn patterns and structures in the data.

**Quantum Support Vector Regression (QSVR>`_:** QSVR extends the concept of QSVM to regression tasks. It uses quantum computing techniques to perform regression analysis, potentially offering advantages in terms of efficiency and accuracy over classical regression algorithms.

=====================================
Details how to work with Dynex Neuromorphic torch layers, which can be used in any NN model, in PyTorch. Examples include hybrid models, neuromorphic-, transfer- and federated-learning.

Dynex Qiskit class
=====================================
Thanks to groundbreaking research from Richard H. Warren, it is possible to directly translate Qiskit quantum circuits into Dynex Neuromorphic chips. The concept behind is a direct translation of Qiskit objects, but instead of running on IBM Q, the circuits are executed on the Dynex Neuromorphic platform. Here is an example of a one-qubit adder circuit using this approach:

.. code-block:: Python

   from dynex.qiskit import QuantumRegister, ClassicalRegister
   from dynex.qiskit import QuantumCircuit, execute

   # Input Registers: a = qi[0]; b = qi[1]; ci = qi[2]
   qi = QuantumRegister(3)
   ci = ClassicalRegister(3)

   # Output Registers: s = qo[0]; co = qo[1]
   qo = QuantumRegister(2)
   co = ClassicalRegister(2)
   circuit = QuantumCircuit(qi,qo,ci,co)

   # Define adder circuit
   for idx in range(3):
       circuit.ccx(qi[idx], qi[(idx+1)%3], qo[1])
   for idx in range(3):
       circuit.cx(qi[idx], qo[0])

   circuit.measure(qo, co)

   # Run
   execute(circuit)

   # Print
   print(circuit)

Dynex Scikit-Learn Plugin
=====================================
This package provides a scikit-learn transformer for feature selection using the Dynex Neuromorphic Computing Platform. It is built to integrate seamlessly with scikit-learn, an industry-standard, state-of-the-art ML library for Python. This plug-in makes it easier to use the Dynex platform for the feature selection piece of ML workflows. Feature selection â€“ a key building block of machine learning â€“ is the problem of determining a small set of the most representative characteristics to improve model training and performance in ML. With this new plug-in, ML developers need not be experts in optimization or hybrid solving to get the business and technical benefits of both. Developers creating feature selection applications can build a pipeline with scikit-learn and then embed the Dynex Platform into this workflow more easily and efficiently. â€‹The package's main class, SelectFromQuadraticModel, can be used in any existing sklearn pipeline.
