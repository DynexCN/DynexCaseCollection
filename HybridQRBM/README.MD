# Dynex QRBM (Pytorch)

Computing on Quantum or neuromorphic systems is fundamentally different than using traditional hardware and is a very active area of research with new algorithms surfacing almost on a weekly basis. In this article we will use the Dynex SDK (beta) to perform an image classification task using a transfer learning approach based on a Quantum-Restricted-Boltzmann-Machine (“QRBM”) based on the paper “A hybrid quantum-classical approach for inference on restricted Boltzmann machines”. It is a step-by-step guide on how to utilize neuromorphic computing with Python using PyTorch. This example is just one of multiple possibilities to perform machine learning tasks. However, it can be easily adopted to other use cases.
